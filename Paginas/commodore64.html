			<h1>Commodore 64</h1>
			<h2>History</h2>
			<div class="text">The Commodore 64, also known as the C64 or the CBM 64, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International (first shown at the Consumer Electronics Show, in Las Vegas, January 7–10, 1982). It has been listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units. Volume production started in early 1982, marketing in August for US$595 (equivalent to $1,509 in 2017). Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its name from its 64 kilobytes (65,536 bytes) of RAM. With support for multicolor sprites and a custom chip for waveform generation, the C64 could create superior visuals and audio compared to systems without such custom hardware.

The C64 dominated the low-end computer market for most of the 1980s. For a substantial period (1983–1986), the C64 had between 30% and 40% share of the US market and two million units sold per year, outselling IBM PC compatibles, Apple computers, and the Atari 8-bit family of computers. Sam Tramiel, a later Atari president and the son of Commodore's founder, said in a 1989 interview, "When I was at Commodore we were building 400,000 C64s a month for a couple of years." In the UK market, the C64 faced competition from the BBC Micro and the ZX Spectrum, but the C64 was still one of the two most popular computers in the UK.

<h2>Hardware</h2>
<div class="text">Microprocessor CPU:<br>
•	MOS Technology 6510/8500 (the 6510/8500 is a modified 6502 with an integrated 6-bit I/O port)<br>
•	Clock speed: 0.985 MHz (PAL) or 1.023 MHz (NTSC)<br>
Video: MOS Technology VIC-II 6567/8562 (NTSC), 6569/8565 (PAL)<br>
•	16 colors<br>
•	Text mode: 40×25 characters; 256 user-defined chars (8×8 pixels, or 4×8 in multicolor mode); or extended background color; 64 user-defined chars with 4 background colors, 4-bit color RAM defines foreground color<br>
•	Bitmap modes: 320×200 (2 unique colors in each 8×8 pixel block), 160×200 (3 unique colors + 1 common color in each 4×8 block)<br>
•	8 hardware sprites of 24×21 pixels (12×21 in multicolor mode)<br>
•	Smooth scrolling, raster interrupts<br>
Sound: MOS Technology 6581/8580 SID<br>
•	3-channel synthesizer with programmable ADSR envelope<br>
•	8 octaves<br>
•	4 waveforms per audio channel: triangle, sawtooth, variable pulse, noise<br>
•	Oscillator synchronization, ring modulation<br>
•	Programmable filter: high pass, low pass, band pass, notch filter<br>
Input/Output: Two 6526 Complex Interface Adapters<br>
•	16 bit parallel I/O<br>
•	8 bit serial I/O<br>
•	24-hours (AM/PM) Time of Day clock (TOD), with programmable alarm clock<br>
•	16 bit interval timers<br>
RAM:<br>
•	64 KB, of which 38 KB (minus 1 byte) were available for BASIC programs<br>
•	1024 nybbles:262 (512 bytes) color RAM (memory allocated for screen color data storage)<br>
•	Expandable to 320 KB with Commodore 1764 256 KB RAM Expansion Unit (REU); although only 64 KB directly accessible; REU mostly intended for GEOS. REUs of 128 KB and 512 KB, originally designed for the C128, were also available, but required the user to buy a stronger power supply from some third party supplier; with the 1764 this was included. Creative Micro Designs also produced a 2 MB REU for the C64 and C128, called the 1750 XL. The technology actually supported up to 16 MB, but 2 MB was the biggest one officially made. Expansions of up to 16 MB were also possible via the CMD SuperCPU.<br>
ROM:<br>
•	20 KB (9 KB Commodore BASIC 2.0; 7 KB KERNAL; 4 KB character generator, providing two 2 KB character sets)<br>

					<h2 class="sidebar_subtitle">Commodore MAX</h2>
					<p class="sidebar_text">In 1982, Commodore released the Commodore MAX Machine in Japan. It was called the Ultimax in the United States, and VC-10 in Germany. The MAX was intended to be a game console with limited computing capability, and was based on a very cut-down version of the hardware family later used in the C64. The MAX was discontinued months after its introduction because of poor sales in Japan.</p>

					<h2 class="sidebar_subtitle">Commodore SX-64</h2>
					<p class="sidebar_text">Also in 1983, Commodore released the SX-64, a portable version of the C64. The SX-64 has the distinction of being the first full-color portable computer. While earlier computers using this form factor only incorporate monochrome ("green screen") displays, the base SX-64 unit features a 5 in (130 mm) color cathode ray tube (CRT) and an integrated 1541 floppy disk drive. Unlike most other C64s, the SX-64 does not have a cassette connector</p>

					<h2 class="sidebar_subtitle">Commodore 64C</h2>
					<p class="sidebar_text">The C64's designers intended the computer to have a new, wedge-shaped case within a year of release, but the change did not occur. In 1986, Commodore released the 64C computer, which is functionally identical to the original. The exterior design was remodeled in the sleeker style of the Commodore 128. The 64C uses new versions of the SID, VIC and I/O chips being deployed, with the core voltage reduced from 12V to 9V. Models with the C64E board had the graphic symbols printed on the top of the keys, instead of the normal location on the front. The sound chip (SID) was changed to use the MOS 8580 chip. </p>
